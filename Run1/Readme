RevisedMCTS is the main file, all others are functions called within it

The parameters are preset to: 
T = 100 (trials)
N = 40  (grid size)
L = 100 (loops)
c = 2   (exploration constant)
rv = 1  (vision radius)
TLimit = 10000  (stopping time if rw goes too long)

SM is the values of sigma to be tested, currently set to {0, 1, ..., 10}

When run, the program will display the trial number (t) as it progresses
The final output is a table of Average Steps, Average Steps Over Optimal (ASOO), 
Variance, and Average Time for each value of sigma in SM
